## Introduction

We conduct a sanity check on **"whether the task of AI-generated image detection has been solved"**. To start with, we present **Chameleon** dataset, consisting AI-generated images that are genuinely challenging for human perception. To quantify the generalization of existing methods, we evaluate 9 off-the-shelf AI-generated image detectors on **Chameleon** dataset. Upon analysis, almost all models classify AI-generated images as real ones. Later, we propose **AIDE**~(**A**I-generated **I**mage **DE**tector with Hybrid Features), which leverages multiple experts to simultaneously extract visual artifacts and noise patterns.

## Update
* **TODO**: Release the Chamelon dataset üìå.
* We release the code and checkpoints of AIDE üî•.

## Requirements

We test the codes in the following environments, other versions may also be compatible:

- CUDA 11.8
- Python 3.10
- Pytorch 2.0.1
