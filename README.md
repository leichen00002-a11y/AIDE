* [2024-06-20]🔥🔥🔥 We release the code and checkpoints of AIDE.


## 🔍 Chameleon 

**Comparison of `Chameleon` with existing benchmarks.**

<p align="center"><img src="docs/Chameleon.jpg" width="800"/></p>

We visualize two contemporary AI-generated image benchmarks, namely:

- **(a) AIGCDetect Benchmark** 
- **(b) GenImage Benchmark** 

where all images are generated from publicly available generators, such as ProGAN (GAN-based), SD v1.4 (DM-based), and Midjourney (commercial API). These images are generated by unconditional situations or conditioned on simple prompts (e.g., *photo of a plane*) without delicate manual adjustments, thereby inclined to generate obvious artifacts in consistency and semantics (marked with <span style="color:red">red boxes</span>).

In contrast, our **`Chameleon`** dataset in **(c)** aims to simulate real-world scenarios by collecting diverse images from online websites, where these online images are carefully adjusted by photographers and AI artists.

## 👀 Overview

We conduct a sanity check on **"whether the task of AI-generated image detection has been solved"**. To start with, we present **Chameleon** dataset, consisting AI-generated images that are genuinely challenging for human perception. To quantify the generalization of existing methods, we evaluate 9 off-the-shelf AI-generated image detectors on **Chameleon** dataset. Upon analysis, almost all models classify AI-generated images as real ones. Later, we propose **AIDE**~(**A**I-generated **I**mage **DE**tector with Hybrid Features), which leverages multiple experts to simultaneously extract visual artifacts and noise patterns.
