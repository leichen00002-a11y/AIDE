## Introduction

We conduct a sanity check on **"whether the task of AI-generated image detection has been solved"**. To start with, we present **Chameleon** dataset, consisting AI-generated images that are genuinely challenging for human perception. To quantify the generalization of existing methods, we evaluate 9 off-the-shelf AI-generated image detectors on **Chameleon** dataset. Upon analysis, almost all models classify AI-generated images as real ones. Later, we propose **AIDE**~(**A**I-generated **I**mage **DE**tector with Hybrid Features), which leverages multiple experts to simultaneously extract visual artifacts and noise patterns.

## News
* **TODO**: Release the Chamelon dataset.
* üî•üî•üî•We release the code and checkpoints of AIDE.

## Requirements

We test the codes in the following environments, other versions may also be compatible:

- CUDA 11.3
- Python 3.10
- Pytorch 1.11.0


## Installation

Please refer to [install.md](docs/install.md) for installation.

## Get Started

Please see [Training.md](docs/TRAINING.md) for details.


## Dataset

### Training Set
We adopt the training set in [CNNSpot](https://github.com/peterwang512/CNNDetection) and [GenImage](https://github.com/Andrew-Zhu/GenImage).

### Test Set
The whole test set we used in our experiments can be downloaded from [AIGCDetectBenchmark](https://github.com/Ekko-zn/AIGCDetectBenchmark?tab=readme-ov-file) and [GenImage](https://github.com/Andrew-Zhu/GenImage).
